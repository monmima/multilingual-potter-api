# Purpose of this project

This is an attempt at creating a multilingual Harry Potter API. The back-end is built using Laravel and SQLite.

The columns from the database that have the string ***fandom*** in their titles are available under [CC-BY-SA](https://www.fandom.com/licensing) unless otherwise noted on Harry Potter Wikis.
